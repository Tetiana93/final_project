# COVID-19 Trend Analysis

This repository contains the trend analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths using the Prophet forecasting model and seasonal decomposition. The trend analysis aims to provide insights into the direction of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

## Overview

The trend analysis utilizes the Prophet forecasting model and seasonal decomposition to analyze the trend component of COVID-19 cases and deaths data. The trend component represents the underlying direction in which the COVID-19 data is moving over time.

## Data

The data used for the analysis consists of weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths counts from  nursing homes and were submitted through the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The dataset includes the date (ds) and the corresponding trend values for cases and deaths.

## Interpretation

The trend values represent the trend component of the COVID-19 cases and deaths data. A positive trend indicates an increasing trend, while a negative trend indicates a decreasing trend. The seasonal decomposition helps to identify the seasonal patterns and trends more accurately.

Based on the analysis:

- The trend for COVID-19 cases shows an initial surge, followed by fluctuations over time.
- The trend for COVID-19 deaths initially increases but then starts to decrease steadily.
- Seasonal decomposition reveals periodic patterns in both cases and deaths data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying trends.
